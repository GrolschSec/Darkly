# Vulnerability Report

## Summary

A Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password vulnerability exists in the `Darkly` application. This flaw allows attackers to manipulate the password recovery process to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by exploiting weak or poorly implemented recovery mechanisms.

## Vulnerability details

### CWE Reference

- **CWE ID**: [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html)

### Description

The password recovery mechanism in the application is poorly implemented. During the recovery process, the user is not required to verify their identity securely. Instead, the client sends an email address as part of the recovery request, which can be intercepted and modified by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Access the password recovery page at http://darkly/index.php?page=recover.
2. Click the `Submit` button and intercept the request using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
3. Modify the email address in the intercepted request to an attacker-controlled email.
4. Submit the modified request.

### Observed Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Reset passwords for any account by intercepting and modifying recovery requests.
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive accounts and compromise user data.

## Mitigation

1. **Strict Identity Verification**:
   - Enforce secure identity verification during the password recovery process.
   - Example in PHP:
     ```php
     if ($user_email !== $registered_email) {
         die("Invalid recovery request.");
     }
     ```
   - Use verified contact methods such as email or phone for recovery communications.

2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Require MFA during the password recovery process for additional security.
   - Example: Send a one-time code via SMS or an authenticator app and validate it before completing the recovery.
