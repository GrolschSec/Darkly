# Remediation for Improper Validation of HTTP Headers

To mitigate this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

1. **Avoid Using Headers for Access Control**:
   - Do not rely on HTTP headers like `Referer` or `User-Agent` for critical security decisions, as they can be easily manipulated.

2. **Implement Server-Side Authentication**:
   - Use proper authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

3. **Log and Monitor Header Anomalies**:
   - Log unexpected or unusual header values and monitor them for signs of malicious activity.

4. **Validate User Inputs Properly**:
   - If headers are used for secondary functionality, validate them server-side to ensure they match expected patterns or values.

5. **Use Secure Tokens for Access Control**:
   - Instead of relying on headers, use secure tokens (e.g., JWT or session IDs) to manage user access.

By implementing these measures, the application will no longer depend on insecure headers for access control, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.
