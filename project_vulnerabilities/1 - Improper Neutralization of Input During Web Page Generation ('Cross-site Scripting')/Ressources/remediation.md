# Remediation for Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

To mitigate Stored XSS vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Implement strict input validation on both client and server sides.
   - Reject any input containing characters that can be interpreted as code (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`).

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Use libraries or frameworks to properly encode data before rendering it in HTML. For example, encode `<` as `&lt;` and `>` as `&gt;`.

3. **Sanitization**:
   - Sanitize all user input before storing it in the database.
   - Use libraries like `DOMPurify` for client-side sanitization.

4. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement a CSP header to restrict the execution of inline scripts.

5. **Avoid Inline JavaScript**:
   - Refactor your application to eliminate inline JavaScript and event handlers.

6. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Regularly test your application for XSS vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual auditing.

Implementing these measures ensures malicious input cannot be executed as code in the browser.
