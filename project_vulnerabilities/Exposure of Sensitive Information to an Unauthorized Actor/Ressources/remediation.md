To mitigate this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

1. **Restrict Access to Sensitive Files**:
   - Configure the web server to deny access to sensitive files like `.htpasswd` and `.env`.
   - Example for Apache:
     ```apache
     <Files ".ht*">
         Require all denied
     </Files>
     ```

2. **Disable Directory Listing**:
   - Prevent directory listing to avoid exposing files within directories.
   - Example for Apache:
     ```apache
     Options -Indexes
     ```

3. **Use Secure Cryptographic Algorithms**:
   - Replace MD5 with modern hashing algorithms like `bcrypt` or `Argon2` for password storage.
   - Apply a salt to ensure hash uniqueness.

4. **Implement Strong Authentication**:
   - Use multifactor authentication (MFA) for sensitive administrative pages.
   - Limit login attempts to prevent brute-forcing.

5. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:
   - Use encryption to protect data in transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., database encryption).

6. **Monitor and Audit Access**:
   - Log access to sensitive directories and files.
   - Regularly audit logs for unauthorized access attempts.

7. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Deploy a WAF to block unauthorized access and detect suspicious activity.

By implementing these measures, sensitive information will be better protected against unauthorized actors.
