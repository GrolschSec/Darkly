# Remediation for Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password

To mitigate weak password recovery mechanisms, follow these best practices:

1. **Strict Identity Verification**:
   - Require strong identity verification during the password recovery process.
   - Use secure methods such as:
     - Sending a recovery link to a verified email address or phone number associated with the account.
     - Ensuring that the email address in the recovery request cannot be modified.

2. **Limit Recovery Attempts**:
   - Restrict the number of password recovery attempts per user or IP address.
   - Implement rate limiting and account lockouts to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. **Server-Side Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs server-side to prevent manipulation of sensitive data.
   - Ensure that the recovery request adheres to expected formats and permissions.

4. **Use Temporary Recovery Tokens**:
   - Generate **time-limited recovery tokens** for password recovery:
     - Tokens should expire within 15-30 minutes.
     - They must be invalidated after a single use.

5. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Add an additional layer of security by requiring MFA during password recovery.
   - Example: Send a validation code to the user's mobile device or an authenticator app.

Implementing these measures ensures a secure password recovery process and prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.
