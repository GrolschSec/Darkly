# Remediation for SQL Injection

To mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs on both the client and server sides.
   - Reject inputs containing special SQL characters, such as `'`, `"`, `--`, and `;`.

2. **Use Prepared Statements**:
   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure user inputs are treated as data, not executable SQL.
   - Example in PHP:
     ```php
     $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT first_name, surname FROM users WHERE user_id = ?");
     $stmt->execute([$user_id]);
     ```

3. **Limit Database Privileges**:
   - Use the principle of least privilege for database accounts.
   - Restrict access to only the tables and operations necessary for the application.

4. **Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Use a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts in real-time.

5. **Monitor and Log Suspicious Activity**:
   - Enable logging of SQL queries and monitor logs for suspicious patterns or errors.

6. **Regularly Update and Patch**:
   - Keep database management systems and application frameworks up to date with the latest security patches.

Implementing these measures significantly reduces the risk of SQL Injection.
