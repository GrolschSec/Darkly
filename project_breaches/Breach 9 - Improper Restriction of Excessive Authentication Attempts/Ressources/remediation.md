# Remediation for Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts

To mitigate this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

1. **Enforce Account Lockout**:
   - Lock accounts after a predefined number of failed login attempts.
   - Example: Lock the account for 15 minutes after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Introduce delays between failed login attempts to make brute-force attacks impractical.
   - Example: Add a 5-second delay after each failed attempt.

3. **Use CAPTCHA for Failed Attempts**:
   - Introduce CAPTCHA after a certain number of failed login attempts to distinguish between bots and legitimate users.

4. **Monitor and Log Authentication Activity**:
   - Log all failed login attempts and monitor for patterns of abuse.
   - Alert administrators for unusually high login failures from a single IP.

5. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Require an additional layer of authentication (e.g., a code sent to the userâ€™s email or phone).

6. **Provide Feedback Without Leaking Information**:
   - Avoid indicating whether the username or password is incorrect during login failures.

Implementing these measures ensures the application is resistant to brute-force attacks and protects user accounts.
