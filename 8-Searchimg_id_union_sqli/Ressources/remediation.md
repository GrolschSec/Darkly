# Remediation for SQL Injection

To mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries**:
   - Ensure all database queries use prepared statements to separate SQL code from data.
   - Example in PHP:
     ```php
     $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM list_images WHERE id = ?");
     $stmt->execute([$id]);
     ```

2. **Sanitize and Validate Input**:
   - Validate all user input server-side and reject malicious patterns.
   - Use input validation libraries or frameworks for common checks.

3. **Restrict Database Permissions**:
   - Use the principle of least privilege to limit database user permissions.
   - Ensure the application user cannot access `information_schema` or other system tables.

4. **Monitor and Log Suspicious Queries**:
   - Log all SQL queries and monitor for unusual patterns or repeated failed queries.

5. **Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**:
   - Deploy a WAF to block malicious SQL queries and detect injection attempts.

6. **Employ Regular Security Testing**:
   - Use automated and manual penetration testing to identify SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

By implementing these measures, the application can prevent SQL Injection and protect sensitive data.
