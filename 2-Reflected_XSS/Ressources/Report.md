# Vulnerability Report

## Summary

A reflected XSS vulnerability was identified in the `src` parameter of the media rendering page. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `src` parameter, which are executed in the victim's browser when the page is loaded.

## Vulnerability details

### CWE Reference

- **CWE ID**: [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

### Description

The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input for the `src` parameter. The value of `src` is directly rendered within the `data` attribute of an `<object>` tag without any escaping or validation. As a result, attackers can inject JavaScript payloads using `data:` URIs, leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Navigate to the following URL:
   ```plaintext
   http://darkly/index.php?src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCg0Mik8L3NjcmlwdD4K
   ```
2. The page renders the injected payload within an `<object>` tag, resulting in the execution of the following JavaScript:
   ```html
   <script>alert(42)</script>
   ```
3. The browser displays an alert box with the text `42`, demonstrating the vulnerability.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to theft of sensitive information, such as cookies or session tokens.

## Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, validate and sanitize the `src` parameter to allow only trusted input, escape output using `htmlspecialchars()`, and disallow dangerous schemes like `data:`. Additionally, implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict unauthorized script execution.
