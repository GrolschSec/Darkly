# Vulnerability Report

## Summary

An Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability exists in the `Darkly` application. This flaw allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks on the login page to guess user credentials due to the absence of restrictions on repeated authentication attempts.

## Vulnerability details

### CWE Reference

- **CWE ID**: [CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)

### Description

The login page of the application does not impose limits on authentication attempts. This allows attackers to repeatedly try different credentials without triggering any lockout, delay, or additional verification mechanism, making the application susceptible to brute-force attacks.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Navigate to the login page http://darkly/index.php?page=signin.
2. Attempt multiple incorrect logins in quick succession.
3. Observe that no lockout or delay is enforced after multiple failed attempts.
4. Use a brute-force tool (e.g., `brute.py`) to automate credential guessing:
```bash
python3 utils/brute.py <Darkly IP> <Path to Wordlist>
```
5. Once the script identifies a valid password, use it to log in and gain unauthorized access.

### Observed Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Perform brute-force attacks to guess user passwords.
- Compromise user accounts and access sensitive information.

## Mitigation

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Introduce delays between failed login attempts to slow down brute-force attacks.
   - Example in PHP:
    ```php
    sleep(5); // Delay for 5 seconds after a failed login attempt
    ```
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - Require an additional layer of authentication (e.g., a code sent to the userâ€™s email or phone).
