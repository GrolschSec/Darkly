# Remediation for Insecure Input Validation

To mitigate input validation vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Implement Server-Side Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs on the server to ensure they conform to expected ranges or formats.
   - For example, ensure the `valeur` parameter only accepts integers between 0 and 10.

2. **Enforce Client-Side Validation**:
   - Use client-side validation as an additional layer, but do not rely on it as the sole protection.

3. **Use Whitelisting for Input Validation**:
   - Define strict rules for acceptable inputs rather than trying to identify and block invalid ones.

4. **Monitor and Log Input Anomalies**:
   - Log all unexpected or out-of-range inputs for further analysis and potential abuse patterns.

5. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevent attackers from repeatedly exploiting input validation flaws by limiting the rate of requests.

6. **Sanitize User Inputs**:
   - Sanitize all user inputs to remove any potentially harmful characters or patterns.

Properly validating and sanitizing inputs ensures the application behaves as intended and protects sensitive information.
